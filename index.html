    <h1>Annotations of Early Draft of Declaration of Independence</h1>
    <p>"The act for opening free ports in the West-Indies declares Negroes a <i>lawful commodity</i><br> 
     and to be imported and sold there upon paying a certain duty; but neither upon the passing<br>
     that act, nor upon the passing any former one for the encouragement of the African trade, does<br> 
     there appear a single protest in abhorrence of that trade, or of <i>treating rational creatures as property</i>."</p><br><br><br>
    
     <p>"[It] was the case in some parts of Britain not many years since, to transfer the service of the<br>
        inhabitants and the power over their lives, with the title to the lands; and it was the universal<br>
        practice among the Asiatic nations, the Jews on excepted, to consider a man's wife and children<br>
        as his effects, and to sell them for the satisfaction of his creditors, as appears from all history<br>
        ancient and modern, but most authentically from the parable of debtor and creditor, recorded by St. Matthew."</p><br><br><br>
    
     <p>"The Negroes being arrived in our colonies, are put up to sale by their owners, and the planters purchase<br>
      them. The Fantees are generally carried to Jamiaca, where they are greatly valued on account of their<br>
      hardiness and high spirit. But as they were freemen in their own country, they are very difficult to be<br>
      managed as slaves, and this is the principal reason of the frequent insurrection in that island; while upon<br>
      the continent especially, insurrections are seldom heard of."</p>
