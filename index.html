     entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that<br>
     they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation."</p><br>
		  
     WE hold these Truths to be self-evident: that all Men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with<br>
		  inherent and inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, & the pursuit of happiness: that to <br>
		  secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or <br>
		  abolish it, & to institute new government, laying it's foundation on such principles, & organizing it's <br>
		  powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety & happiness. Prudence indeed <br>
		  will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light & transient causes; and <br>
		  accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, <br>
		  than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses &<br>
		  usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce<br>
		  them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government, & to provide new<br>
		  guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; & such is now the <br>
		  necessity which constrains them to expunge their former systems of government. The history of the present king<br>
		  of Great Britain is a history of unremitting  injuries & usurpations, among which appears no solitary fact to<br>
		  contradictthe uniform tenor of the rest but all have in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny<br>
		  over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a<br>
		  faith yet unsullied by falsehood.
