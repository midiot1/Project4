    <p><center>"WHEN in the Course of human Events it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands<br>
     which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth the separate & equal Station to<br>

     entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that<br>
     they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation."</p><br>
		  
                  WE hold these Truths to be self-evident: that all Men are created equal; that they are endowed by their<br>
		  creator with inherent and inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, & the pursuit of happiness:<br>
		  that to  secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent<br>
		  of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of <br>
		  the people to alter or abolish it, & to institute new government, laying it's foundation on such principles,<br>
		  & organizing it's powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety & happiness.<br>
		  Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light & transient <br>
		  causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are<br>
		  sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long<br>
		  train of abuses & usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object, evinces<br>
		  a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such<br>
		  government, & to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these<br>
		  colonies; & such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former systems of government.<br>
		  The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting  injuries & usurpations, among<br>
		  which appears no solitary fact to contradictthe uniform tenor of the rest but all have in direct object the<br>
		  establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world<br>
		  for the truth of which we pledge faith yet unsullied by falsehood.<br><br><br><br><br>
